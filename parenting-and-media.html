          <h3><b>Developmental Issues or Milestones</b></h3>
          <h4>We live in a world full of media!</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Average child less than 2 has 1+ hours of media per day; 2+ hours per day for 2 year olds; children spend 4-8 hours with media per day; 11-18 year olds spend 11 hours on average with media per day; 60% of families have 3+ televisions in their home</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>AAP Guidelines for Children (2016)</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>They experience more concrete-operational thought (understand the point of view of others more) rather than egocentrism</li>
            <li>Educational milestones
              <ul>
                <li>Under 18 months – avoid screen time other than video chatting</li>
                <li>18-24 months – choose high-quality programing and watch it with them so they understand what they’re seeing; limit to 30 min – 1 hour</li>
                <li>Ages 2-5 – limit screen time to 1 hour per day of high-quality programs; watch it with them and help them understand</li>
                <li>Ages 6 + - place consistent limits on media time and content, make sure it doesn’t take place of getting enough sleep and other health behaviors</li>
                <li>Designate media-free times (dinner, driving) together and location in the home (bedroom!!)</li>
                <li>Have ongoing communication about safety online and treating others with respect online</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Cognitive and Social Effects of Media</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Educational media is linked to increased academic achievement and literacy</li>
            <li>Prosocial media is linked to increased sympathy and prosocial behavior</li>
            <li>Heavy media is linked to lower attention and academic achievement</li>
            <li>Violent media is linked to aggression</li>
            <li>Advertising of cigarettes and drugs is linked to smoking/drinking</li>
          </ul>

          <h3><b>Concerns for Children with Parenting and Media</b></h3>
          <h4>Children view a lot of violence in media that is often portrayed as humorous. On average, by the time a child is 18 years old they will have witnessed 200,000 media-portrayed acts of violence, including 40,000 murders.</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>I think this will get increasingly more difficult with time as violence in media becomes more and more common. I plan to only allow my children to play up to a T-rated video game and watch only up to PG-13 rated movies. I also plan to discuss with my children why interacting with violent media has a negative effect and ask them how they feel when they view it. I plan to monitor their media, and allow them to make more decisions about what media to watch as they get older.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Children are exposed to sexual media that depicts permissive sexual attitudes and is associated with earlier sexual debut.</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Like violence, this is something that is extremely common in media today. I plan to use media together with my children so that we can discuss what the media is portraying, like discussing what certain song lyrics mean. This can provide opportunities to teach about moral principles and healthy sexuality. I hope to create an open environment where sexuality can be discussed, and I can ask them what they think about the choices made by characters in the media and the consequences of those choices. I plan to pre-arm them against pornographic material so they can make wise decisions about what media to participate in and what media to avoid.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Technoreference (when individual media use interferes with relationships) is prevalent today and can cause harm to relationships that parents and children experience.</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>To address this concern, I plan to control my media usage more so that I can be more present with my children and the people I interact with. I also plan to have certain times, like at night, where everyone will turn in their media so they can go to bed without distractions. Research has shown that parents who are involved in their children’s media usage have more positive effects, so I also plan to use media together as a family and emphasize that instead of individual media use.</li>

          <h3><b>Supplemental Materials</b></h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Quotes I like:
              <ul>
                <li>“Technology in and of itself is neither inherently good nor bad. Rather, the purposes accomplished with and through technology are the ultimate indicators of goodness or badness” – Elder Bednar</li>
                <li>“’Be where you are when you are there.’ When you are driving, drive. When you are in class, focus on the lesson. When you are with your friends, give them the gift of your attention.” – Elder Ridd</li>
                <li>"Some of you would not knowingly tolerate pornography in your homes, and yet you would allow music into your lives that can be just as devastating." -Elder Russell M. Nelson</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Media 101 for Parents
              <ul>
                <li>Family media can strengthen, individual media can detract – all things in moderation</li>
                <li>NO media in the bedroom, have a media curfew</li>
                <li>Turn off the TV (background media)</li>
                <li>It is OK to say no to media, set the rules early and stick with them</li>
                <li>Check ratings on media (effects of video games rated T and above are more negative)</li>
                <li>All media can have an effect: music, books, social networking – stay on top of it!</li>
                <li>Monitor, monitor, monitor</li>
                <li>Help your children be active consumers of media – discuss media and its effects with them (before and after media exposure)</li>
                <li>Limit cocooning as children get older, they need to learn to make good choices</li>
              </ul>
