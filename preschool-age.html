            <h3><b>Concerns Relevant to Preschool-age Children</b></h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Potty Training – potty training can be very frustrating for parents.
                <ul>
                  <li>To address this issue, I will try to make potty-training fun for my children! Research shows that you should wait until your child is ready, and you can tell they are ready if they are showing interest in it (asking questions) and can take their pants off and put them back on. A few ways that I can make it more enjoyable are these: let them pick out underwear and a potty seat; dress them appropriately; reinforce instead of punish; schedule potty breaks; get rid of distractions in my life for a few days while training; be creative (sticker chart or having boys aim at fruit loops); teach good hygiene; praise them when they are successful!</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Keeping children safe as they are able to move around much more now.
                <ul>
                  <li>I am very paranoid about this issue, so I am grateful for all of the suggestions we have in order to keep kids safe! Safety guidelines recommend that children always wear bike helmets, ride in car seats (until 40 pounds) or booster seats (until age 8 or 57 inches tall) in the back seat (until age 12). I plan to follow these guidelines as well as these general safety recommendations: remove fragile or sharp objects from areas accessible to children; safety devices in outlets; baby locks on cabinets; stairway gates; lock up cleaning supplies; not hanging picture frame over a child’s bed; put fences around pools and yard.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Children can be picky eaters, so it can be hard for parents to get them to eat healthy food.
                <ul>
                  <li>There are many things that can help with this, like following a routine for meals and snacks but also respecting whether or not your child is hungry. I can serve new foods with others they like and with fun shapes and colors and set a good example by eating the healthy foods that I don’t like as much. I also plan to involve my children in preparing food and planning the meals! Some things to avoid would be cooking to order and offering dessert as a reward.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Parents must decide whether or not to send their children to preschool and which one to send them to.
                <ul>
                  <li>I will determine if my children are ready based on how well they can separate from their dad and me and how well they make friends and handle emotion. In choosing a school, I will consider the quality, student-teacher ratio, and how focused the school is on the child’s development.</li>
                </ul>
