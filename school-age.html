          <h3><b>Key Developmental Milestones</b></h3>
          <h4>Physical Development</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Physical growth is slower than previous years</li>
            <li>Brain is almost to adult size</li>
            <li>Better resistance to disease and infections</li>
            <li>Puberty can begin as early as age 7 for girls!</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Cognitive Development</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>They experience more concrete-operational thought (understand the point of view of others more) rather than egocentrism</li>
            <li>Educational milestones
              <ul>
                <li>Age 5 – count to 20</li>
                <li>Age 6 – early reading</li>
                <li>Age 7-8 – addition and subtraction</li>
                <li>Age 9 – multiplication</li>
                <li>Age 8-9 – can read chapter books</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Emotional and Social Development</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Industry vs. Inferiority stage – they should believe that they can do important tasks</li>
            <li>They need to develop a sense of belonging, worth and competence</li>
            <li>Parents can help in the development of self-esteem by encouraging instead of giving answers, praising effort rather than performance and giving them an opportunity to see what they’re interested in.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Moral and Spiritual Development</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Moral
              <ul>
                <li>Morality develops from being externally imposed and controlled by parents to internalization of moral rules and principles</li>
                <li>Under age 8 – rules are more concrete and inflexible; they judge what is wrong in terms of what the consequences are</li>
                <li>Over age 8 – understanding that rules are socially agreed upon principles; they judge what is wrong in terms of what the person’s intention is</li>
                <li>Parents should reinforce children’s good behavior and teach children what is and is not appropriate. They should also teach against aggression and teach principles of kindness beginning at an early age!</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Spiritual
              <ul>
                <li>Age 8 – age of accountability; cognitive developments allow them to know right from wrong</li>
                <li>Parents should set more concrete patterns of scripture study, tithing, fasting, and other principles. Also, they should bring up spiritual discussion, answer questions, and focus on repentance and covenants.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3><b>Concerns Relevant for School-age Children</b></h3>
          <h4>Many school age children may experience bullying physically or socially.</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>In order to prevent my children from bullying other children, I plan to teach them principles of kindness and that acting aggressively will not get them what they want. I plan to try to be a good example and refrain from saying unkind things about other people and include others. If my children experience the bullying, I plan to teach them to be kind to those who are unkind and help the bullying stop.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Parents must choose which school they should send their children to.</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>I plan to look into the public and charter schools in whatever area my family ends up in to determine the student-teacher ratio, focus on students, and how well the school with fit with my child’s specific needs.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Parents should avoid overscheduling their children.</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>This is a big issue for some children because their parents are having them do too much! I plan to give my children the opportunity to explore different activities that they could be interested in and helping them continue the ones they are interested in while cutting out the ones that they show less interest in.</li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
            <li>Questions to ask for how to determine if your child is ready for school:

                <li>Talk to a preschool teacher or doctor</li>
                <li>Visit a kindergarten class</li>
                <li>Can your child follow instructions?</li>
                <li>Can your child sit still for short periods of time?</li>
                <li>Can your child put on a coat and go to the bathroom?</li>

                <li>Can your child hold a pencil and cut with scissors?</li>
                <li>Does your child show interest in books?</li>
                <li>Is your child curious about learning new things?</li>

            <li>Quotes I like:
              <ul>
                <li>“We need to learn and then teach each other take upon ourselves the Savior’s characteristics. If we are true to our natures as the Lord has outlined them for us, our basic masculinity and femininity will not come into question. We should all have both strength and sensitivity, courage and compassion, tenacity and tenderness. And as we best incorporate all those traits within our beings, we will be true to the male or female in us, which has been part of us since the beginning.” – Ida Smith</li>
