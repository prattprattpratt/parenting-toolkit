          <h3><b>Three Pillars of a Healthy Marriage</b></h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Commitment
              <ul>
                <li>Constraint commitments are the ones that keep spouses together though they may prefer to be separated</li>
                <li>Personal dedication is the intentional decision to stay in a marriage for mutual benefit. It keeps the marriage together! It takes these things:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Intentional personal dedication – you sacrifice for the relationship and seek welfare of partner</li>
                    <li>Exclusive cleaving and unity – spousal preeminence; spouse comes before job, social relationships, etc. </li>
                    <li>Practicing spiritual patterns together!</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Connection
              <ul>
                <li>True love in marriage comes from deep friendship. So it is important to do things your spouse likes to do, talk as friends, and respond to bids for connection by turning towards them. Make an effort to connect with your spouse.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Conflict
              <ul>
                <li>Conflict doesn’t damage a marriage, but contention does. Positive to negative interactions so be about 5:1 in ratio.</li>
                <li>Make decisions together and respectfully handle differences.</li>
                <li>Focus on your spouse’s positive qualities; don’t dwell on faults!</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3><b>Questions to Ask Myself From Linda K. Burton</b></h3>
          <ul>
            <li>When was the last time I sincerely praised my companion, either alone or in the presence of our children?</li>
            <li>When was the last time I thanked, expressed love for, or earnestly pleaded in faith for him or her in prayer?</li>
            <li>When was the last time I stopped myself from saying something I knew could be hurtful?</li>
            <li>When was the last time I apologized and humbly asked for forgiveness—without adding the words “but if only you had” or “but if only you hadn’t”?</li>
            <li>When was the last time I chose to be happy rather than demanding to be “right”?</li>

          <h3><b>Marriage and Parenting</b></h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Marriages will change with time, but children aren’t the only influence that will change it. A couple should try to resolve issues that already are present before the baby comes; babies aren’t the cause of the problems. </li>
            <li>A couple can find greater marital satisfaction as they seek balance between their roles, share expectations, make time to talk together and make an agenda, experiment together, and make time for sex and intimacy.</li>
            <li>Mothers and fathers should co-parent. Mothers should encourage fathers to be involved in the full range of parenting and be positive! He should have some time alone with the kids, and she should trust him and not set standards too high.</li>
            <li>Be united in decision making with your spouse because children will pick up on parents’ disagreements. Discuss unsettled issues before giving an answer to children.</li>

            <h3><b>Goals for Keeping Marriage Healthy Before and After Children</b></h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Goal 1 – Continuously develop a connection with my husband to increase our friendship and love throughout our marriage.
                <ul>
                  <li>My favorite memories from my marriage with my husband so far have been times when I have realized that he’s become my best friend. I know that it takes work to continue a friendship in an eternal marriage, and it is incredible to me that our friendship can keep deepening and growing if we’re willing to work on it. I would like to learn more about what my husband likes to do, why he likes to do it, and then dedicate “caring days” where we can do what he likes to do. I also want to make sure we continue having conversations as friends even when we start to have children and a lot of other responsibilities. I will try to think more of his needs and desires so that I can know how to make him happy. I would like to be better at keeping a journal to record the experiences we’re having and to look back on how our relationship has grown and changed.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Goal 2 – Focus on the positive qualities that my husband has!
                <ul>
                  <li>It’s really easy sometimes to fault-find and place blame, but doing so is very damaging to a marriage and can cause unnecessary misery within it. I plan to focus on my husband’s positive qualities by making a list of them once a month. I would like to read through this list when I feel frustrated. This will help me to appreciate him more and see things from his point of view.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Goal 3 – Co-parent with my husband so that we are both fully involved in parenting our children.
                <ul>
                  <li>This will be very important for my husband and me because I tend to be overly concerned about the well-being of others and how certain things should be done. It will be important for my spouse and me to care for our children and do housework in our unique ways and to support each other in doing so. If we show trust in each other’s ability to parent our children, we will be more united and feel more complete as parents. I plan to allow him time to interact with our children and to appreciate his efforts as he helps them to get ready for school or other activities.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Goal 4 – Be united in decision making with my husband so that our children such that our children know that we are united.
                <ul>
                  <li>I plan to continue discussing with my husband issues that we need to make decisions on together before we have children and after we have children. When we disagree about something for our children, we will discuss the issue privately until we come to a decision on it, and then we will let them know what we have decided on. I will not contradict my husband in front of our children.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                  <li>“While marriage is difficult, and discordant and frustrated marriages are common, yet real, lasting happiness is possible, and marriage can be more an exultant ecstasy than the human mind can conceive. This is within the reach of every couple, every person.” – President Kimball</li>
                  <li>“Love as distinct from “being in love” is not merely a feeling. It is a deep unity, maintained by the will and deliberately strengthened by habit…They can have this love for each other even at those moments when they do not like each other…It is on this love that the engine of marriage is run: being in love was the explosion that started it.” - C. S. Lewis, Mere Christianity</li>
                </ul>
