        <h1 class="subsection-header">3 Broad Parenting Goals to Demonstrate Positive Parenting</h1>
        <div class="col-md-4">
          <h3><b>Goal 1: Be an authoritative parent!</b> Authoritative parenting is the parenting style which demonstrates the highest levels of both warmth and control, both of which are critical to positive parenting. Research shows that authoritative parenting brings the most positive child outcomes such as high self-esteem, social competence, self-control and higher internalization.</h3>
          <h4>Three Specific Behaviors to Achieve This Goal:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Encourage my children to give input when making family decisions</li>
              <ul>
                <li>An example of this could be when my husband and I set a curfew for our children. I can explain to them why it’s important to get home by the time set both for them and for the parents who will be waiting up for them. As I consider this with my children I can ask them what time they think is reasonable and we can come to a decision on a time.</li>
              </ul>
            <li>Use induction when my children do something wrong – this is so important!!</li>
              <ul>
                <li>An example of this could be when one of my children says something unkind about someone else. Instead of just telling them that it’s wrong to speak unkindly, I can ask how they think the other person would feel if they knew what was said about them or how they would feel if someone said something similar about them. This would help them to internalize why the behavior is not appropriate.</li>
              </ul>
            <li>Be warm and listen patiently to my children’s point of view</li>
              <ul>
                <li>An example of this could be when my child gets into an argument with a sibling or friend. I can ask my child for their perspective and try to understand why they feel the way they do. After listening, I can validate their feelings and give suggestions.</li>
              </ul>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4">
          <h3><b>Goal 2: Be a proactive parent!</b> Proactive parents parent in anticipation of their child’s behavior instead of in response to it. This has shown to be beneficial because it helps children be ready for the decisions they’ll make and the challenges they might face.</h3>
          <h4>Three Specific Behaviors to Achieve This Goal:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Prepare my children for new events in their life</li>
              <ul>
                <li>An example of this could be when I’m preparing my young children to go to preschool. I can explain to them what will happen there so they feel ready and nothing is a surprise to them.</li>
              </ul>
            <li>Prepare my children for situations in which they will have to make hard decisions</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Instead of trying to make sure my children do not ever come in contact with pornography or other bad influences, I can teach them what it is and why it is not correct. After we talk about it, I can ask them what they will do if they come in contact with the negative influence so they can have an idea for what they will do.</li>
              </ul>
            <li>Deference - allow my children to make their own decisions after I’ve pre-armed them</li>
              <ul>
                <li>An example of this could be once I have already talked with my teenager about how they can judge if a movie is appropriate or not and then letting them choose whether or not to watch it.</li>
              </ul>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4">
          <h3><b>Goal 3: Avoid being an over-protective parent!</b> Over-protective parenting is when a parent is overly concerned about their child’s success and well-being. Research shows that this leads to many negative child outcomes like low self-confidence and learned helplessness. In order to be a more positive parent, my goal is to avoid this parenting style!</h3>
          <h4>Three Specific Behaviors to Achieve This Goal:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Do not be overly concerned about my children’s health</li>
              <ul>
                <li>An example of this would be allowing my children to go on age-appropriate hikes with their father even though I am afraid of heights and would fear that they would fall.</li>
              </ul>
            <li>Allow my children to try new things even if they might fail</li>
              <ul>
                <li>If one of my children would like to try out for a sports team, I can encourage them to do so and help them to prepare for try outs even if they might not make it.</li>
              </ul>
            <li>Appropriately encourage my children to do things for themselves even if the task if difficult</li>
              <ul>
                <li>If I see one of my children struggling with a difficult homework problem, I can encourage them to keep working on it instead of just showing them how to do it so that they can learn more from the homework problem.</li>
              </ul>
          </ul>

        <h1 class="subsection-header">Challenges I Might Face in Achieving These Goals</h1>
        <div class="subsection-single-item">
          <ul>
            <li>One challenge that I might face in achieving these goals is that I tend to overreact when I am worried about something. This could make it hard for me to listen patiently to a child’s point of view when I think he/she has done something wrong. It will also make it hard for me to not become overly concerned about my child’s well-being.</li>
              <ul>
                <li>To overcome this challenge, I can work on being aware of my own temperament and how it is affecting the situation so that I can recognize that I am worrying more than I need to. </li>
              </ul>
            <li>Another challenge I could face is learning how to prepare my children for difficult things they will face. It wasn’t common in my household for my parents to talk with me about how to face negative influences, so this will be a pattern I will need to set.</li>
              <ul>
                <li>To overcome this challenge, I can strive to create frequent and open communication with my children so that they can feel comfortable discussing difficult subjects.</li>
              </ul>
          </ul>
