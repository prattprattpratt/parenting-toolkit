          <h3><b>Physical Development</b></h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Physical growth is quick for first two years of life, then slows, down, then grows quickly again during puberty; Girls begin puberty about 2 years earlier than boys and reach maturity faster</li>
            <li><img src="/media/adolescence-puberty-boys.png" style="width: 50%;"><img src="/media/adolescence-puberty-girls.png" style="width: 50%;"></li>
            <li>They need 9+ hours of sleep per night, but 2/3 don’t get that much which is harmful</li>
            <li>To avoid negative body image issues, parents can refrain from making comments about their body and the bodies of their children as well as establish healthy, active habits</li>
            <li>Brain development continues in the frontal lobe until the age 25. This area is associated with planning, organizing, problem solving, memory, impulse control, decision making, selective attention, and self-regulation.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="col-md-4">
          <h3><b>Cognitive Development</b></h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Adolescent Egocentrism – adolescents think that others are just as concerned about their appearance and behavior as they themselves are (just as admiring or critical as they are about themselves). They don’t separate between what others think about and their own concerns.</li>
            <li>Adolescents perform to an imaginary audience which makes them feel like others are always watching them; they are worried about feeling shame and may desire for privacy.</li>
            <li>Adolescents experience “personal uniqueness” – they do not distinguish between what is unique and what is universal. “You do not know how it feels!” </li>
            <li>Adolescents experience “personal fable” – they think that their own life is heroic or mythical and that bad things will not happen to them. Examples: think that they will not get pregnant; think that if they commit suicide others will hurt and they will be even for the pain others had caused them.</li>
            <li>Parents can help by developing intimate relationships with their adolescents!</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="col-md-4">
          <h3><b>Emotional and Social Development</b></h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Teens have more extreme emotions. Parents can help them discover what emotion anger is masking and know that emotions are okay. Parents can help them have healthy outlets.</li>
            <li>Age 12-17 – Identity and Repudiation vs Identity Diffusion (Role Confusion)
              <ul>
                <li>Parents should help their adolescents achieve identity achievement meaning they can commit to clear self-set goals. They must go through moratorium (searching ideologies and delaying commitments) to achieve this. If they do not they can experience identity foreclosure where they just adopt their parent’s goals or identity diffusion where they do not care about setting goals. </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Adolescent Autonomy
              <ul>
                <li>Parents should encourage adolescents to achieve emotional (can manage emotions independently) and behavioral (can make decisions independently) autonomy.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Adolescents shouldn’t work more than 10 hours per week! Doing so could lead to sleep deprivation and worsen mental disorders such as depression and anxiety.</li>
            <li>Adolescents should be encouraged to date in groups and be taught the why of chastity. Encourage them to make friends with members of the opposite gender!</li>
          </ul>

        <div class="col-md-4">
          <h3><b>Moral and Spiritual Development</b></h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Moral</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Adolescents experience conventional reasoning – based on societal norms; they can see another person’s perspective; golden rule; empathy-based morality.</li>
                <li>Parents should have moral discussions with adolescents where they can express their opinions. They should give them opportunities to serve and debate.</li>
              </ul>
            <li>Spiritual</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Early adolescence – synthetic-conventional faith – adolescents can understand religion and abstract concepts more and do not take things so literally as they did in childhood.</li>
                <li>Late adolescence/emerging adulthood – reflective faith – they develop individualized faith by personal experiences and questioning religion.</li>
                <li>There are many positive outcomes for religious teens!</li>

            <h3><b>Concerns Relevant to Adolescence and Emerging Adulthood</b></h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Parent-adolescent conflict is common for parents to experience with teenagers as they are experiencing extreme emotions and forming a sense of identity.
                <ul>
                  <li>o	Research shows that the relationship is the most important thing to maintain, and this is especially important during the child’s teenage years. Some things that can help are using soft startup when beginning a conversation, listening, allowing your children to make mistakes, and pray a lot. I plan to use these suggestions when facing conflict with my teenagers.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Adolescents face a lot of peer pressure, and parents may be concerned that their child is receiving influence from their peers more than their parents.
                <ul>
                  <li>o	Research shows that adolescents whose parents who have demonstrated authoritative parenting tend to be influenced more by their parents than their peers for long term values such as education, religious, moral and political values though peers influence their short term value such as media and clothing choices. Less-than optimal parenting such as inconsistent discipline and not monitoring children’s activities tends to lead to teenagers ending up in a negative social group where their peers will have a lot more influence on their decisions. I plan to use the characteristics of authoritative parenting to encourage my children to have positive social interactions with others. </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Adolescents face a lot of negative influences such as drug use. Many teens today abuse drugs and prescription drugs.
                <ul>
                  <li>o	Research shows that teens are 42% less likely to use drugs when their parents talk to them regularly about it. Open disclosure (instead of solicitation) is the best way for parents to get information about their teenager’s drug use. Parents should let their teenagers know that they will monitor them and strive to maintain the relationship. I plan to communicate openly with my children about drugs at a young age so that they are aware of it and continue the open communication with them into their teenage years. </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Parents must decide how much support to give as their children enter into emerging adulthood. Many parents demonstrate helicopter parenting during this time.
                <ul>
                  <li>o	This will probably be difficult for me, so I know I will need to take care to pay attention to the way I act during this time period in my children’s lives. Research shows that the outcomes from helicopter parenting aren’t as negative as those from behavioral control, but it interferes with the transition to adulthood and delays it. Research also shows that college students are generally more likely to finish school if their parents support them financially. I will strive during this stage to encourage my children to make their own decisions and face their own consequences. I will encourage them to be as independent as they can financially while in school and assist them if needed. </li>
                </ul>
