            <h3><b>Concerns Relevant to Infants and Toddlers</b></h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Breastfeeding – Parents must decide whether or not the mom should breastfeed their baby and for how long.
                <ul>
                  <li>Research shows many pros of breastfeeding for the baby and the mom. Some of them are that it creates attachment between the baby and mother, has all the nutrients the baby needs, is easier for the baby to digest and it releases hormones in the mother’s body that promote mothering behavior. The cons include that it is painful, the baby may have trouble latching and the mother may have a hard time producing enough milk. Since research shows that the pros generally outweigh the cons, I plan to breastfeed for at least the first year and see a lactation specialist if I have troubles with it.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Safe sleeping - Parents must take many precautions to ensure that their infants are safe while sleeping to avoid things like suffocation and SIDS.
                <ul>
                  <li>I plan to try to ensure that my babies sleep on their backs, have a safe crib free of loose bedding, keep the room at a decent temperature and keep them within sight or sound always. Research shows that these help prevent suffocation and SIDS.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Immunizations – Parents must decide whether or not to immunize their babies and when to get such immunizations.
                <ul>
                  <li>Research has shown that vaccinations save millions of lives per year, are safe, help prevent the spread of disease, save time and money and have to medical link to autism. There is a small chance (one in a million) that children can have a fatal allergic reaction to it. I plan to immunize my children according to the immunization recommended by a pediatrician since it has been shown that overall vaccinations help to protect rather than harm.</li>
