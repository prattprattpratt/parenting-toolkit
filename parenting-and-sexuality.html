          <h3><b>Developmental Issues or Milestones</b></h3>
          <h4>Young Children</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>It is not uncommon for very young children to be interested in their bodies and to touch themselves. This is normal and natural!</li>
            <li>Parents shouldn’t respond in shaming ways or over-react, but rather use distraction as their primary mode with young children.</li>
            <li>Parents should teach children how their bodies work and celebrate them! Use correct names for body parts!</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Older Children</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Sexual latency may occur in early childhood</li>
            <li>Puberty can begin as early as age 7-8 for girls and 9-10 for boys, so start talking about it sooner than you planned!</li>
            <li>Age 12 – first menarche; age 14 – first spermarche</li>
            <li>Children who are prepared for puberty and sexuality report to have better experiences than those who aren’t </li>
            <li>NO object lessons!</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Parents can always teach about sexuality – it is never too early or too late to discuss it. No guilt!</h4>

        <div class="col-md-4">
          <h3><b>Concerns for Children with Parenting and Sexuality</b></h3>
          <h4>As children experience puberty, they may feel uncertainty or guilt about their sexual nature.</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>To address this concern, I will start teaching my children from an early age about their bodies and that it is normal for them to have sexual feelings. I plan to discuss puberty with my children before age 7-8 so that they will be aware of the ways in which their bodies will develop. I will explain to them why they should control these feelings so they will be excited about expressing them within marriage.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Children may feel uncomfortable discussing sexuality with their parents; parents may also feel uncomfortable discussing sexuality with their children, and as a consequence the children don’t learn about sexuality from the correct places.</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>All too often, parents never talk to their children about sex, and children feel uncomfortable going to their parents with questions about it. Research shows that a culture of openness can be created if parents change the “how”, change the “when”, and focus on the “why” as they talk to their children about sexuality. I will change the “how” by creating a good relationship with my children and being open and non-reactive when discussing questions or concerns about sexuality. I will change the “when” by making sure that instead of having one conversation about sex, we have many conversations about it. I will focus on the “why” by teaching them the beauty of intimacy within marriage and the emotional, spiritual, and behavioral consequences of being unchaste before and after marriage.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Children who are uneducated about sexuality are more likely to engage in sexual activity and follow peer norms.</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Research suggest that most parents wait to educate their teens about sex until their children are already sexually active, and many religious teens experience STDs and teen pregnancy as a consequence of being less educated. My husband and I will proactively educate our children about sexuality so that they will know they can come to us for questions about it rather than peers or the internet. I plan to prearm them rather than cocoon them from sources that threaten chastity. Research shows that doing so results in later sexual debut, safer sexual practices and higher levels of health sexuality.</li>

          <ul>
            <li>Quotes I like:
              <ul>
                <li>“As our children grow, they need information taught by parents more directly and plainly about what is and is not appropriate. Parents need to teach children to avoid any pornographic photographs or stories… talk to them plainly about sex and the teaching of the gospel regarding chastity. Let this information come from parents in the home in an appropriate way.” - Elder Ballard</li>
                <li>“When morality is involved, we have both the right and the obligations to raise a warning voice.” – President Packer</li>
                <li>“Sexual fragmentation is particularly harmful because it is particularly deceptive. The intense human intimacy that should be enjoyed in and symbolized by sexual union is counterfeited by sensual episodes which suggest--but cannot deliver--acceptance, understanding, and love.” - Elder Holland</li>
                <li>“I know I can’t turn back time, but this I now know—that it’s never too early and it’s never too late to lead, guide, and walk beside our children, because families are forever.” - Elder Foster, 2015</li>
              </ul>
