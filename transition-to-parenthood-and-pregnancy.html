          <h3><b>Concerns Relevant for Transition to Parenthood and Pregnancy</b></h3>
          <h4>The transition to parenthood can be difficult as it leads to changes in love and leisure time with your spouse and changes in employment for one or both parents.</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Research suggests that finding time to spend together as a couple, teamwork and accepting new roles have a positive impact on transitioning to parenting. I plan to find time to spend alone with my husband once a week so that we can get that time together and be able to enjoy more fully the other responsibilities that we’ll have as parents. I plan to discuss with him our new roles.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Infertility can be a struggle for a couple who wishes to become parents. About 1/10 couples struggle with it.</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>I hope to be sensitive around others who may be facing this struggle. If my husband and I struggle with infertility, I plan to go to an infertility doctor to see what we can do to treat it. If we struggle for a long time with it, I plan to adopt children. Research shows that it can be treat with medication for women to induce ovulation, intrauterine inseminations or assisted reproductive technology.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Pregnant mothers must be particularly careful about what they ingest while pregnant and breastfeeding.</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>I plan to follow closely the guidelines about what to eat and what not to eat while pregnant and breastfeeding. I will avoid drugs that aren’t prescribed by a doctor, raw food, hot dogs/lunch meat, unpasteurized dairy, fish and supplements.</li>
          </ul>
